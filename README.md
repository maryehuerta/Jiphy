### How to Clone and Run
To get started go into your terminal and type in the command

`https://github.com/maryehuerta/Jiphy.git`

Then go into the directory you just cloned
`cd Jiphy`

To install dependencies in the local node_modules folder. `npm install` will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json. These are things your program needs to run but take up a lot of space in github so people usually want you to download these separately using `npm install`.

`npm install`

Now to run! This is running locally on your machine.
`npm start`

Where's my React website?
If your react website didn't pop up the your browser of choice right away go into the browser and type http://localhost:3000/ into the url. You should be able to see it. If you don't check the terminal for compile errors.
